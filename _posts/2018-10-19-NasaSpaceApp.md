#### [A GLOBAL COMMUNITY](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/)

Part of the Open Government Partnership, Space Apps is an annual event that pulls citizens together regardless of their background or skill level. Don't let the name fool you... it's not just about apps! Tackle a challenge using robotics, data visualization, hardware, design and many other specialties!
