# [A GLOBAL COMMUNITY](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/)

R-Ladies Space Apps is an international hackathon that occurs over 48 hours in cities around the world. Because of citizens like you, we continue to grow each year. If you haven't already, join us to share ideas and engage with open data to address real-world problems, on Earth and in space. Work alone or with a team to solve challenges that could help change the world. Check back here to find a Space Apps event near you, or sign up to participate virtually.

[THE WORLD NEEDS YOUR IDEAS](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/news/announcing-spaceapps-2018-challenge-categories)

Part of the Open Government Partnership, Space Apps is an annual event that pulls citizens together regardless of their background or skill level. Don't let the name fool you... it's not just about apps! Tackle a challenge using robotics, data visualization, hardware, design and many other specialties! Inspire each other while you learn and create using stories, code, design and, most of all, YOUR ideas. Show us your problem-solving skills and share your talents with the world!
